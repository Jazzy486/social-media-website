    <p class="para-text">Social media has revolutionized the way we communicate with others, allowing us to connect with people from all over the world instantly. However, this instant communication may come at the expense of quality communication. Online communication can be less personal and may lack the nonverbal cues that are crucial for effective communication. Additionally, social media can lead to misunderstandings, as the tone and intent of messages may be misinterpreted. Studies have shown that social media has impacted the way we speak and write, with young people tending to use vulgar vocabulary that does not consider common values or traditions. The impact of social media on young web users’ psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic progression has also been studied, with results showing that young people spend almost all day online due to the obsessive pattern of social media involvement and/or procrastination, which often provokes withdrawal syndrome upon the attempt to distract from them. Therefore, it is important to be aware of its potential drawbacks and to use it responsibly to maintain quality communication.</p>

      <p class="para-heading">Social Interaction</p>
      <br>

      <p class="para-text">While social media has made it easier to connect with others, it has also contributed to social isolation, particularly when individuals spend excessive amounts of time on social media, to the detriment of face-to-face interaction. For instance, the FOMO on social media can negatively impact romantic relationships, as users may become overly preoccupied with checking their devices and miss out on in-person interactions A study conducted among students of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, Universitas Airlangga, found that social media has both positive and negative impacts on students' social interactions with their environment. One of the positive effects of social media is that students get the latest information more easily. Meanwhile, one of the negative impacts is that students become addicted to using social media to not interact with their environment.</p>

      <p class="para-text">Another example, it is a survey of 518 Australians examining Facebook usage, relationship satisfaction, and household income found that for most respondents, social media usage did not have a negative impact on their relationship. However, results indicated that where their partner was a ‘friend’ on social media, they were less likely to report concerns relating to social media usage impacting their relationship. Another study found that social media can be used to establish relationships with customers and keep them informed, which greatly influences the development of new products, as well as organizational performance. In any case, it is important to strike a balance between online and offline interactions to maintain healthy social relationships. </p>

      <br><br>
      
      <p class="para-text">Social media can be a useful tool for seeking emotional support, while simultaneously it can also contribute to cyberbullying and feelings of exclusion. Studies have shown that social media can be an effective way to distribute support during crises, but it is often limited to those who already have social connections. Migrants, for example, use mobile ICT to connect with different social ties to fulfill their needs, which potentially makes a difference to their psychological well-being. The impact of social media on self-injurious behaviour in adolescents is also a growing concern, as it can either improve psychological well-being by providing support and information or increase the person's susceptibility to self-injury by initiating their interest in this subject and reinforcing and encouraging repeated self-harm. A study conducted on the effect of social media on health status showed that as the duration on social media increased, health-related troubles such as obesity, hypertension, and stress also increased. Therefore, it is essential to use social media responsibly and be aware of its potential impact on mental and physical health.</p>
