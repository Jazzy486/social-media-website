  <div class="info-text"> 
    <br>
    <p class="para-text">Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, are designed to be captivating and addictive. These platforms rely on several features, like infinite scrolling, notifications, and likes, to keep users engaged and coming back for more. These features may seem innocent at first glance, but they have a profound effect on our brain's reward pathways, potentially leading to addictive behaviours.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="para-heading">Infinite Scrolling</p>
    <br>
    
    <p class="para-text">Infinite scrolling is a feature commonly found on social media platforms that allows users to scroll endlessly without ever reaching the end. This feature has reshaped how users interact with mobile apps and online platforms, but it has also been criticized for its negative effects on mental health and well-being. Infinite scrolling is likened to a virtual slot machine that offers dopamine-inducing variable rewards, making it hyper-addictive. Recent studies have shown that infinite scrolling can fuel social comparison, trigger anxiety, and lead to information overload.</p>
    <br><br>
    
    <img class="para-img" src="images/intro-img.jpg" alt="intro-img">
    <br><br>
    
    <p class="para-text">One study examined the effects of Pinterest-style infinite scrolling layouts on user contributions to social commerce sites. The study found that the new layout design had opposite effects on the two types of user contribution: a positive effect on users' appreciation of others' sharing, but a negative effect on users' original sharing. Another study investigated the effect of webpage content displayed on discrete pages versus an infinitely scrolling page on users' recollection of content and browsing satisfaction. The study found no statistically significant difference between the paginated and infinite scrolling blogs for either browsing satisfaction or content recall. Infinite scrolling has also been linked to negative effects on mental health and well-being, such as envy and low self-esteem. Females ranging in age from 13 years to 26 are amongst the highest percent to develop depression through social media. However, incidental brief exposure to news on the Internet can be a powerful tool for mitigating these issues by bringing news to the awareness of people who are politically disinterested. A study found that incidental brief exposure mitigated the negative effect of social media usage on news knowledge.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="para-text">Despite its negative effects, infinite scrolling remains a popular feature on many websites and apps. To break free from obsessive infinite scrolling, users can try limiting their screen time, setting boundaries, and using apps that limit their access to social media. But in any case, it is important to be aware of the negative effects of infinite scrolling and to take steps to protect one's mental health and well-being.</p>

    <section id="Notifications">
    <p class="para-heading">Notifications</p>
    <br>
    <p class="para-text">Notifications on social media platforms can also trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, leading to compulsive social media use and an increased likelihood of addictive behaviours. The addictive use of wireless mobile devices (WMDs) was linked to the 'incentive sensitization theory of addiction': repeated exposure to potentially addictive stimuli (i.e., notifications) can cause persistent structural and functional brain changes in the prefrontal cortex. The hyper-reactive dopamine system could also drive this compulsive behaviour in the form of a habit-loop of cue, craving, response, and reward. </p>
    <br><br>

    <p class="para-text">Overuse of WMDs was associated with insufficient and low-quality sleep, obesity, dyslipidemia, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Each hour/day increase in screentime was associated with a 0.05-0.07 increase in body mass index (BMI) likely due to food marketing, distracted eating, reduced satiety, and procrastination of physical activity. To achieve life-technology balance, practical strategies include eliminating redundant notifications, deleting time-consuming applications, modifying the digital environment at home and work, and replacing screentime with green time.</p>
    <br><br>

    <img class="para-img" src="images/Notifications.jpg" alt="intro-img">
    <br><br>

    <p class="para-text">Other tactics could include using an alarm clock, wearing a wristwatch, specifying times to check emails and social media, refocusing teams to decrease reliance on text messages, and lowering expectations of immediate responses. While it would be irrational to suggest complete avoidance of all WMDs, moderation, balance, and real-life engagement together with strategies aimed at disrupting the dopamine habit-loop can help achieve life-technology balance.</p>

    <section id="Likes and Social Validation">
    <p class="para-heading">Likes and Social Validation</p>
    <br>

    <p class="para-text">Social media platforms are designed to encourage users to seek validation from others through likes, comments, and shares. This desire for social approval is a fundamental aspect of human behaviour, as it helps to reinforce our sense of belonging and self-esteem. However, when this need for validation becomes intertwined with social media use, it can lead to a powerful addiction. Receiving likes and other forms of positive feedback activates the brain's reward pathways, increasing dopamine levels and fostering a sense of pleasure and accomplishment. </p>

    <p class="para-text">Several studies have been conducted to validate instruments assessing addiction to social networking sites (SNSs) in different languages, including Italian, Romanian, Greek, and Portuguese. These studies have found that social media addiction is associated with attachment styles, stress, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and decreased empathy levels. The studies also found that social media addiction is more prevalent among younger individuals and those who spend more time connected to social media. The validation of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) in different languages has provided a reliable and valid tool for assessing social media addiction. The BSMAS is a short 6-item questionnaire that assesses social media addiction and has been found to have an excellent fit of the model to the data, confirming the single-factor structure of the instrument. The scale has also been found to have satisfactory levels of fit, reliability, and validity.</p>
