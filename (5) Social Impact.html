    <br>
    
    <p class="para-text">Social media platforms have become a primary venue for political discourse, allowing politicians, activists, and citizens alike to share their views and engage in debate. While this increased accessibility can foster democratic engagement and the exchange of ideas, it also has the potential to promote partisanship and polarization. Algorithms employed by social media platforms often prioritize content that reinforces users' existing beliefs, creating echo chambers that can exacerbate divisions and diminish opportunities for meaningful dialogue. However, some studies have found little evidence for this polarisation, lending credence to a rejection of social media’s “echo chamber” effect. The use of disinformation on social media that may affect political campaigns has also attracted researchers’ attention. Digital networks viewed as a consolidating resource for generating trust and shared values necessary to establish credible commitments through e-driven cooperative pursuits have been explored. Unsupervised and data-driven language understanding methods make it possible to quantify large amounts of unstructured natural language corpora, which can be used for feature engineering in supervised machine learning algorithms and the possibility of classifying text’s political partisanship. The evolution of digital technologies and the attendant expansion of the communication network pose ethical difficulties for journalists connected with increased speed and volume of information, a diminished place in the network, and the cross-border nature of information flow. These challenges are exacerbated by intentional manipulation of social media, human-run or automated, in many countries including internal suppression by authoritarian regimes and foreign influence operations to spread misinformation.</p>

      <br>

      <p class="para-text">The proliferation of misinformation on social media is a growing concern that can have serious consequences for society. Inaccurate or misleading information can be disseminated quickly and easily, often reaching large audiences before it can be debunked or corrected. This can lead to the formation of misinformed opinions and, in some cases, contribute to the erosion of trust in institutions and experts. Studies have shown that perceived misinformation exposure decreases media trust, and that this effect is especially pronounced among individuals with low political knowledge. However, psychological inoculation campaigns on social media have been found to be effective at improving misinformation resilience at scale. Misinformation sharing behaviour on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic was found to be motivated by anxiety or risk perception, entertainment, information seeking, sociability, social tie strength, self-promotion, trust in science, self-efficacy, and altruism. To combat misinformation on social media, researchers have identified 13 intrinsic predictors of dissemination, 11 detection approaches, and 10 ways to combat misinformation. It is important for individuals to critically evaluate information before sharing it on social media and to seek out reliable sources to verify information. </p>

      <br><br>

      <p class="para-text">On the one hand, social media can be a powerful tool for mobilizing support for social movements and amplifying marginalized voices. On the other hand, the anonymity and reach of social media can also be exploited to manipulate public opinion through disinformation campaigns and coordinated efforts by bad actors. The formation of public attitudes towards vaccination is greatly influenced by the media and social networks. Vaccine misinformation can be politically and economically ordered. In authoritarian regimes such as China, social media is considered the main battlefield for public opinion struggle between the official discourse and those challenging it. </p>

      <p class="para-text">Consuming news from governmental sources on the country’s major social media platforms was positively associated with citizens’ satisfaction with the central government, while exposure to alternative news sources on social media had a negative impact on both central and local government satisfaction. Additionally, news consumption from mainstream media sources on social media did not significantly influence the public’s government satisfaction. Although human accounts have a more direct influence on the information diffusion network, social bots have a more indirect influence. Unverified social bot accounts retweet more, and through multiple levels of diffusion, humans are vulnerable to messages manipulated by bots, driving the spread of unverified messages across social media. These findings show that limiting the use of social bots might be an effective method to minimize the spread of conspiracy theories and hate speech online.</p>

        <p class="para-heading">Misinformation during Political Events or Crises</p>
        <br>
  
        <p class="para-text">The impact of social media on democracy is multifaceted and complex. While it can provide a platform for political discussion, civic engagement, and voter mobilization, it also has the potential to spread misinformation, polarize public opinion, and manipulate democratic processes. Misinformation is a growing concern on social media, as biased and misleading information can be routinely produced or amplified by mainstream news organizations. Unlike other media providing news, users do not choose the source of articles they see on social media. Instead, proprietary algorithms provide targeted information with little transparency. The prevalence of social media also raises significant concerns about privacy and potential surveillance, with platforms collecting vast amounts of personal data. During times of political events or crises, the spread of misinformation on social media can have dire consequences, leading to confusion, panic, and even violence. However, social media can also play a role in limiting and refuting health misinformation, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. To combat the spread of misinformation, responsible information-sharing and fact-checking practices on social media platforms are urgently needed. Individuals can also take responsibility for their own information consumption and sharing practices by fact-checking information before sharing it and being mindful of the sources of information they consume and share.</p>

        <p class="para-text">In conclusion, the relationship between social media and societal issues is complex and far-reaching. Social media platforms have the power to shape political discourse, influence public opinion, and spread misinformation, with significant implications for democracy, privacy, and the spread of misinformation during political events or crises. Understanding the broader societal impact of social media is essential for developing strategies to address its challenges and harness its potential for positive change.</p>
